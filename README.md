# pandas-challenge

This challenge was a great practice in manipulating dataframes in jupyter notebook with pandas.
A couple observations from the data are as follows:
Charter schools outperformed District schools in average math score and average reading score, with a 90.4% overall passing rate vs the charter schools which yielded a 53.7% overall passing rate. Interestingly, the spending per student did not translate to a higher overall passing rate. Quite the opposite! The lowest spending range of <$585 per student had the highest overall passing rate at 90% vs 53% in the highest per student spending range of $645-680.
